## Analysing response to policies targeted towards combating covid19 in Uganda.

As global communities respond to COVID-19, Google has provided mobility reports to help guide policy to combat covid_19. 

These Community Mobility Reports aim to provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. 

The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.
